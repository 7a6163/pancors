# ðŸ“¡ PanCORS

We all know how it feels when you want to fetch something and CORS screws it all up.

**Meet PanCORS:** super light-weight CORS-anywhere proxy implemented in only 2<sup>6</sup> lines of Go code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. `docker build -t pancors .`
3. `docker run --rm -d -p 8080:8080/tcp pancors:latest`

## Usage

Just pass your desired request the the root endpoint like this:

`https://pan.cors/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmichaljanocko.com`

Please include the scheme (`https` or `http`) to qualify as a valid URL. PanCORS can't proxy other protocols so it has to check.

Also, don't forget to query encode the address because some URI implementations merge neighboring slashes into one if they're part of the path or query (e.g. `https://` wouldn't work and would come out as `https:/` so that why we have to encode it as a param; this is the safest way IMO)

## Manifesto

**_Stop CORS oppresion!_**
